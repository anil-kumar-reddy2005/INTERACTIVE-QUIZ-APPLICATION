DESCRIPTION:

The Interactive Quiz Application is a frontend web project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to simulate a real-world online quiz platform. The main objective of this project is to provide a secure and interactive environment where users can register, log in, and participate in a timed quiz. This application is built without any backend or external libraries, making it lightweight, easy to understand, and ideal for internship tasks, academic mini projects, and frontend portfolio demonstrations.

The project starts with a user authentication system that includes both registration and login functionality. New users can create an account by entering their name, email address, and password. Basic client-side validation ensures that all required fields are filled before submission. The user details are stored in the browser’s localStorage, which acts as a simple data persistence layer. During login, the entered credentials are verified against the stored data, and only valid users are allowed to proceed further into the application.

After successful login, the user is redirected to a protected home page. This page serves as a dashboard and displays a personalized welcome message using the registered user’s name. The home page provides clear navigation options, allowing the user to start the quiz or log out. The logout feature clears the session data from localStorage and redirects the user back to the login page, ensuring that protected pages cannot be accessed without proper authentication.

The quiz module is implemented as a full-page interactive interface to enhance user engagement. It includes a header section displaying the quiz title, a countdown timer, and the user’s live score. The main section displays questions and multiple-choice options in a clean and responsive layout. All quiz questions are loaded dynamically using JavaScript, which makes the quiz easy to extend or modify by simply updating the question data.

A countdown timer is implemented for each question, set to 30 seconds. The timer updates every second and visually alerts the user when time is running low. If the timer reaches zero before an answer is selected, the question is automatically submitted, and the correct answer is highlighted. This feature adds realism and challenge to the quiz, similar to competitive online testing platforms.

The application provides instant feedback after each answer. Correct answers are highlighted in green, while incorrect answers are highlighted in red, along with subtle animations for better user experience. The score is updated in real time and displayed throughout the quiz. A progress bar visually represents the user’s progress, helping them understand how much of the quiz has been completed.

Once all questions are answered, a final result screen is displayed showing the user’s total score along with a motivational performance message. The user can then return to the home page, completing the application flow smoothly. Overall, this project demonstrates strong fundamentals in frontend development, including DOM manipulation, client-side authentication, timer implementation, and UI design, making it a solid and practical project for learning and showcasing JavaScript skills.
